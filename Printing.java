/**
 * This program calculates the volume of various 3D shapes
 * (sphere, pyramid, cone, and cylinder) to determine the
 * amount of resin required for 3D printing.
 *
 * Users can input the dimensions of the desired shape,
 * and the program will compute the corresponding volume,
 * which represents the estimated resin needed.
 *
 * Formulas used:
 *  - Sphere: (4/3) * π * r^3
 *  - Pyramid (square base): (l^2 * h) / 3
 *  - Cone: (π * r^2 * h) / 3
 *  - Cylinder: π * r^2 * h
